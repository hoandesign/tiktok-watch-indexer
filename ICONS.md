# Icon Files Required

The extension requires icon files for the Chrome extension. You need to create three icon sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels  
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

## Quick Solution

You can use any image editor or online tool to create these icons. For a quick start:

1. Create a simple icon (e.g., a magnifying glass or video camera icon)
2. Export it in the three required sizes
3. Place them in the extension root directory

## Temporary Workaround

If you want to test the extension without icons, you can:

1. Create simple colored PNG files using any image editor
2. Or use online tools like:
   - https://www.favicon-generator.org/
   - https://realfavicongenerator.net/
   - Any image editor (GIMP, Photoshop, Canva, etc.)

## Icon Suggestions

- 🔍 Magnifying glass (for search/indexing)
- 🎬 Film/video camera
- 📹 Video camera
- 🎥 Movie camera
- Simple "TI" or "TWI" text logo

The icons should be square and work well at small sizes (16x16).
